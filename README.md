Tessel Opticon is a panoramic stop-motion camera that periodically posts gifs to Twitter. The original stop-motion camera was created by Josh Skrzypek. Modifications to the original design, gif conversion, and Twitter automation was done by me. It was built using the [Tessel microcontroller](https://tessel.io/), its servo and camera modules, and a lot of Legos.
